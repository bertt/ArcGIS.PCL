ArcGIS.PCL
==========

Use ArcGIS Server REST resources without an official SDK.

Typical use case would be the need to call some ArcGIS REST resource from server .NET code or maybe a console app. Rather than having to fudge a dependency to an existing SDK you can use this. 

See the tests for some example calls.
